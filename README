- Prompts to launch downloaded new version executable

CONFIGURE:

RUNNING:
- First time run will fail! if multiple driver packages are detected. Fix by manually removing old oem*.inf driver packages
  Howto:
  	- Find out your current installed active driver version. "System Info" in Nvidia Control Panel
  	- Use the following command to list all driver packages currently installed:
  	    PnPutil.exe -e | grep -C 2 "Display adapters" | grep -A 3 -B 1 "NVIDIA"
  	- Make note of all "Published names: oem*.inf" refferences which is not your current version. ex:
        Published name :            oem8.inf
        Driver package provider :   NVIDIA
        Class :                     Display adapters
        Driver date and version :   11/23/2013 9.18.13.3193
        Signer name :
      "3.3193" is version "33.193"
    - Remove old packages by running the following command for each orm*.inf occurance
        PnPutil.exe -d oem*.inf
        It won't allow you to remove inuse inf packages
- execute by bashing geforce.sh
  examples: 
    ./geforce.sh
    /dir/geforce-driver-update/geforce.sh
    alias geforce='/dir/geforce-driver-update/geforce.sh'
    ln -s "/dir/geforce-driver-update/geforce.sh" /usr/bin/geforce.sh
    bash geforce.sh
    bash /dir/geforce-driver-update/geforce.sh

TODO: 
- add notification switch when update is available
- make crontab friendly
- allow for other types ex: x86 version, only whql
- verify system os and architecture
